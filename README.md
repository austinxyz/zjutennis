## Database Schema

### Player
- Basic information: name, email, gender, phone number
- Location: city, country
- Relationships: OneToOne with PlayerSkills, PlayerStatistics, and PlayerAlumni

- Couple's graduation universities: up to 3 universities with graduation years
- Automatically managed with cascade operations
- Created/updated timestamps

### PlayerSkills
- Technical ratings (1-10): forehand, backhand, serve, volley, smash, etc.

- UTR tracking: rating, status, URL, and last updated timestamp
- NTRP tracking: rating, status, URL
- Match statistics: total matches, wins, losses, win rates
- Performance: serve percentage, break point conversion

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- MySQL 8.0+
- Node.js 16+ and npm

### Database Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root (copy from `.env.example`):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Update the `.env` file with your database credentials:

```properties
DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://your-host:port/zjualumni?ssl-mode=REQUIRED
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

The application will automatically load these environment variables. The `.env` file is gitignored for security.

Alternatively, you can set environment variables directly:

```bash
export DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://your-host:port/zjualumni?ssl-mode=REQUIRED
export DB_USERNAME=your_username
export DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

3. Create the database schema:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE zjualumni;
```

The application will auto-create tables on first run (`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none` is set, but entities are configured with proper JPA annotations).

### Database Migrations

All database migration scripts are located in the `db/` folder with comprehensive documentation:

```bash
db/
├── README.md                                    # Complete migration documentation
├── setup_database.sql                           # Initial database and tables setup
├── create_skill_tables.sql                      # Player skills and statistics tables
├── add_gender_field.sql                         # Add gender field to players
├── add_rating_status_fields.sql                 # Add UTR/NTRP status fields
├── add_statistics_url_fields.sql                # Add URL fields for ratings
├── remove_duplicate_fields_from_players.sql     # Remove duplicate UTR fields
├── db_migration_add_utr_updated_date.sql        # Add UTR update tracking
└── db_migration_add_player_alumni.sql           # Add alumni information table
```

To run migrations, see the detailed instructions in `db/README.md`. Migration order is important - follow the documentation carefully.

**Quick migration example:**
```bash
mysql -h your-host -P port -u username -p database_name < db/db_migration_add_utr_updated_date.sql
```

**Important:** Always restart the backend server after running database migrations to ensure schema changes are picked up.

### UI Components

The frontend uses **shadcn-vue**, a modern component library that provides:

- **Customizable Components**: Built on top of Radix Vue primitives for full control
- **Accessible by Default**: WCAG-compliant components with proper ARIA attributes
- **Beautiful Design**: Professional styling with Tailwind CSS
- **Type-safe**: Written in TypeScript-compatible patterns
- **Icon System**: Lucide Vue Next for consistent, modern icons

**Key Components Used:**
- `Button` - Multiple variants (default, outline, ghost, destructive)
- `Card` - Container components with header, title, and content sections
- `Table` - Fully-featured data tables with sorting capabilities
- `Input` - Form inputs with consistent styling
- `Label` - Accessible form labels
- `Textarea` - Multi-line text inputs
- `Badge` - Status and category indicators

All components follow a consistent design system with proper spacing, typography, and color schemes.

### Backend Setup

1. Build the project:

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
# If using .env file
set -a && source .env && set +a && ./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Or if environment variables are already set
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`
